Principals’ Letter
January 2024
Dear Students and Parents/Guardians,
As you begin to think of what classes to register for next school year, we hope that you use your
MCIS experiences and interest survey results to drive your decision-making. As you look through
the Program of Studies, carefully examine all of the wonderful opportunities. A new addition to
the Program of Studies is a unique course code to define the classes at the high schools. The
new course codes is divided into 6 parts- the department, the subject, the level, the credit, the
semester and the instructional delivery method so that students can make accurate course selection.
Remember, course registration numbers drive what will be offered at each high school. Our staffing
is determined by registration numbers so please choose your courses wisely. Here are some key
things to consider:
•

Challenge yourself. By taking courses that will test you, you will be able to overcome challenges
you will face after high school such as the tougher workload of college courses or standing out in
a competitive job market.

•

Consider taking elective courses. They provide student opportunities to develop skills in critical
thinking, creativity, collaboration and communication to ensure post-secondary and future
readiness.

•

We offer several career programs with a focus on specific career fields. Consider learning about
the medical field in the LNHS Biomedical Science Program or by taking the LOA Certified
Nursing Assistant course, or become an expert in problem-solving through the LSHS STEM
Academy or LNHS Engineering Innovation.

•

A four-year degree is not the path for everyone. There are many innovative careers with good
salaries that can be obtained with two or fewer years of training. Explore some of the courses that
can lead to these careers.

•

Most of all, think of high school as a stepping stone to the next stage of your life. Everyone, no
matter how young or old, is always moving forward to a new step in life. You are about to take
one of the most exciting steps by advancing past high school to master your interests and turn
your craft into a successful career for life.

Students and parents/guardians should work together to select courses that pave the way for a
successful future. Please contact your Dean of Students with any questions.
Sincerely,

Kim Budde
Principal
Lakeville North H.S.

Registration Planning Information

Essential Planning and Registration Information

Each year the registration process begins with the posting of the revised “Program of Studies” and
continues with student and parent meetings, followed by online registration. Students and parents
are encouraged to review all information in each of the links under the Academics tab found on
the homepage of each school’s website and to register online at home, using the registration
instructions. The opening and closing days and times for the registration tab on the Infinite Campus
portal and parent meeting dates and times are posted on the high school calendars and websites.
Paper copies of all curriculum and registration information listed on the website are available upon
request by contacting the Dean’s office, Student Services Office or Lakeville Online Academy
Administrator. Additionally, any student unable to register at home will be assisted in completing
registration at school.

Program of Studies

The curriculum guide for Lakeville high schools is entitled, “Program of Studies.” Included in this
joint document for Lakeville North, Lakeville South and Lakeville Online Academy is an overview
of each curricular area and descriptions of all courses offered in each area. Parents and students
are encouraged to review this document and all accompanying information to assist in planning
an educational program and accounting for student’s completion of credits for graduation. While
parents and students are primarily responsible for ensuring students meet all requirements for
graduation, Deans and the Lakeville Online Academy Administrator are available to assist, support,
and provide guidance in the process.

Instructional Delivery and Location

Each course in the Program of Studies lists instructional delivery method and location. Before
choosing a course, students should be sure to review if the course is taught face-to-face, hybrid
(part time face-to-face and part time online) or fully online. Additionally, because all students are
able to take courses at Lakeville North, Lakeville South or through Lakeville Online Academy,
students should carefully check the location of the course offering.

Credit Check

A document entitled, “Credit Check”, is a one-page summary of all requirements for each class
designated by year of graduation. The credit check illustrates the forty-four semester credits
needed by curricular area, the career portfolio activities to be completed in grades 9-12, and the
standardized testing requirements for graduation. Students must meet all the essential components
in order to earn a diploma and participate in graduation ceremonies.

Course Selection Form

Another document created to assist in registration for classes is entitled, “Course Selection Form”.
The course selection forms include a list of all courses available by grade level. For instance, the
9th grade course selection form lists all required courses and all electives available to freshmen.
Please note, it is important to read each course description in the Program of Studies, as there are
prerequisites for many courses. This form is distributed to all students and is available online during
registration.

Course Code Overview

In this guide, courses are listed by department. Each course has a unique course code to define
the classes at the High Schools. Each course code can be divided into 6 parts: the department,
subject, level, credit, semester and instructional delivery method. These course codes are what
you will use to enroll in courses.
For example, below you see the course code LAE-100-11H for English 9, semester 1 taught in a
hybrid setting.

Career/Postsecondary Planning

In addition to meeting the requirements for graduation, students are encouraged to register for
classes that are academically appropriate for future education or entering the workforce after
high school. Students wishing to go to four-year colleges are strongly recommended to register
for Advanced Placement courses and core courses required for admission. Statistics clearly
indicate students who take core classes (English, social studies, math and science) all four years
will have improved test scores, which may be the difference in obtaining admission at the postsecondary school of choice. Students wishing to attend technical colleges or enter the workforce
are encouraged to look at the many elective offerings in the area most closely associated with
their career goals, and to review possible dual credit or articulated credit options.

Course Requests

Students are required to register for a minimum of 12 semester long courses per year. All courses
are offered on a semester-long basis. When students register, they are required to indicate
alternate choices for electives. Due to space limitations and schedule conflicts, it is extremely
important for students to list alternate choices. Courses will only be offered when warranted by
enrollment and when appropriate staff is available.

Other Considerations

Students who intend to participate in athletics at a Division I or Division II college as a freshman
must meet the eligibility requirements established by the National Collegiate Athletic Association
(NCAA). Eligibility requirements may be obtained through the Deans’ office or Activities/Athletics
website.

Credit Attainment and Schedule Expectations

All courses are offered on a semester-long basis. Students receive .5 credit upon successful
completion of a semester-long course. Transfer grades (from other high schools, college classes,
University of Minnesota Talented Youth Math Program, home school, accelerated learning, online
school, etc.) will be reviewed by the Dean of Students to determine credit placement. Transfer
grades will be used to compute cumulative grade point average (GPA) and class rank. Any student
choosing to take more than 50% of their courses online through Lakeville Online Academy will be a
Lakeville Online Academy student.
Schedule corrections are based on need and availability of courses. Students have three days after
the start of the semester to request schedule corrections. Exceptions may be made at the Dean’s
discretion if special needs or other factors exist. Students are expected to remain enrolled in six
courses each semester. If a special circumstance occurs, a student has the first twenty school days of
a semester to withdraw from a course. Beyond twenty days, any course withdrawal will be recorded
as a “W” on the student’s record and will negatively affect the student’s GPA.
Any student failing a required course or withdrawing before the end of the semester must repeat
the semester course to receive credit. Any student maintaining fewer than five courses per semester
is subject to dismissal for the remainder of the semester. Students may not retake a course in an
attempt to earn a better grade for any course in which they have earned a passing grade (D- or
above).

Standardized Testing Requirements

The State of Minnesota currently requires students to take Minnesota Comprehensive Assessments
(MCAs) in reading (grade 10) and math (grade 11) and science (one time in high school). Students
are not required to achieve a specified score on an assessment in order to meet graduation
assessment requirements. The Minnesota Department of Education requires each school district to
develop a College and Career Readiness plan. Lakeville High Schools will continue to provide MCA
assessments as directed by the Minnesota Department of Education. Per Minnesota Statutes, section
120B.31, subdivision 4a, a parent may exclude their child from MCAs. Parent/Guardian Guide and
Refusal to Statewide Testing Form can be found here in multiple languages on the MN Dept. of
Education website.

Early Graduation

Students may be considered for early graduation if they have successfully met all requirements,
including Lakeville High School credit requirements, State of Minnesota testing requirements, and
Career Portfolio requirements. Students considering early graduation should meet with their Dean of
Students or the Lakeville Online Academy Administrator well in advance of their proposed semester
of early graduation to discuss options and procedures.

14

Commencement

Students who have not fulfilled all graduation requirements are not eligible to participate in the
ISD 194 commencement ceremony.
Senior academic honors recognition is awarded according to the following criteria:
Summa Cum Laude = 4.0 and above GPA
Magna Cum Laude = 3.85 – 3.99 GPA
Cum Laude = 3.7 – 3.84 GPA
Honors recognition will be determined by using the cumulative GPA for each senior at the end of
the first semester senior year.

Lakeville Diploma

Students who choose to take more than 50% of their classes through Lakeville Online Academy
will earn a diploma from Lakeville North or Lakeville South High School. The school from which
the diploma is earned is predetermined when a student enters the Lakeville Online Academy
program.

Advanced Placement (AP)

Students may take Advanced Placement (AP) courses for an opportunity to receive college credit.
Students must achieve a score of a 3, 4 or 5 on the AP test given in the spring to be considered for
college credit. However, each college makes a determination whether or not they will accept the
credits. These courses are designated throughout the Program of Studies. Generally, Minnesota state
colleges accept the credit.
College Board, a non-profit organization dedicated to preparing, inspiring, and connecting students
to college, sponsors the AP program. The College Board writes and administers advanced tests
and studies in almost 40 subjects from Art to Statistics. These tests, representative of freshman
level college knowledge on that subject, form the basis of what is studied in AP courses. Currently,
Lakeville offers 23 AP courses with the intent of challenging students and better prepare them for
college. Each May, students may choose to take a national test that measures their knowledge in the
areas they studied during the year. If a student scores high enough, they will receive college credit at
over multiple post-secondary institutions nationwide.

Test Registration
Registration for the AP exams begins in the fall via an online registration and ordering system.
Personalized registration labels will be supplied for each student included in the exam order,
eliminating the need for pre-administration sessions. Students are able to take an AP exam even
if they did not take the course. Each year the state pays part of the College Board exam fee,
and the student pays the remainder. Due to the test-ordering deadline, late registrations will
not be accepted. The registration payment is non-refundable after the deadline. College Board
predetermines testing dates.

Weighted Grades
Advanced Placement course GPA points equals standard grades points plus one. For example:
Letter grade “A” = 5.0

Articulated Credit

Articulated credit is a way of earning credit at the high school level and college level at the same
time. Certain courses taken at the high school in the Business, Family and Consumer Science and
STEM/Industrial Technology departments are eligible for articulated credit. Eligible courses are
identified in the individual course descriptions. Students will receive credit certificates for the number
of credits they successfully complete. Some certificates are for partial credit for a college course.
When students enroll in the course at college, they will only need to pay for the number of credits
not covered by the certificate. The college makes the determination on all credit allocations.

20

The College-Level Examination Program (CLEP)

CLEP is a College Board program that allows students to earn college credit by demonstrating
their mastery of college-level material in introductory subjects. Students may transfer the credit
(“P” letter grade) to the high school transcript. Costs for the exams vary and are incurred by the
family. For additional information, go to clep.collegeboard.org.

Concurrent Enrollment

Concurrent enrollment allows qualified high school students to earn college credit in their
high school during the regular school day. Several programs are currently offered: College
Now through Southwest Minnesota State University for AP Chemistry and Pre-Calculus at
Lakeville South High School, and Project Lead the Way though St. Cloud State University for
Honors Principles of Biomedical Science, Honors Human Body Systems, and Honors Medical
Interventions at Lakeville North High School. Students must earn a B or better in the class, a
score of 4 or higher on an end of course exam and then submit a $100 registration fee to earn
college credit for Project Lead the Way courses. Transferability of these credits to other postsecondary institutions is not guaranteed.
Classes are taught by qualified high school teachers and supervised by college faculty members.
There is no cost to the student for these courses, providing an outstanding opportunity for
students to earn college credit and high school credit at the same time and jump-starting
their college careers without incurring additional debt. There are criteria established by each
concurrent enrollment program such as earning a minimum grade in the course, or a certain score
on an end of course exam, or paying a fee for application, that need to be met in order for the
credit to be transcripted at the college level.

Credit by Assessment
Students can receive credit for any course offered by the district in any subject area if the student
is able to demonstrate the outcomes for the course. If the student completes the assessment
process in a satisfactory manner, the student’s transcript will show the credit earned and a course
grade of A, A-, B+ or B. Depending on the course, students may earn a semester credit, a full
year credit, or in the case of a full-year course, a student could be given credit for just one of the
semesters.

Credit by Assessment Procedure:
1. Credit by assessment is offered in May and August only. The assessment needs to be
completed prior to the start of a semester.
2. Student requests an application from the Dean’s Office,obtains a parent’s signature and
meets with the Dean of Students.

State of Minnesota Statute)
2. Student may choose to take the course and have the grade earned in the class placed on the
transcript

Credit/No Credit

Students may take one credit per semester on a credit/no credit basis. This option is to encourage
students to explore interests in subjects in which they may not be willing to risk getting a low
grade. Any student who is interested in taking a course on a credit/no credit basis should discuss
arrangements with his/her parents(s), Dean and teacher. Forms are available in the Dean’s or Student
Services Office. The deadline for submitting the request to the Dean’s Office is prior to the end of
1st quarter for first semester requests and/or prior to the end of 3rd quarter for second semester
requests.

22

•

Students who are preparing for a career where this course is a prerequisite should take the
course and be graded under the conventional system.

•

Students must realize that once they sign up for this grading option, they cannot change
grading systems (back to an “A” – “F” grading system) during the course.

•

All students requesting the Credit/No Credit grading system in a course will continue to take
all tests, turn in all regular class work, and receive grades along with other students. Only the
final mark is a “P” or “F”.

•

Students should complete the form, obtain parent approval, teacher approval, and bring
this form to the Deans’ Office. For yearlong courses, the Credit/No Credit option must be
requested each semester the student desires to take the Credit/No Credit option.

•

If a student earns 60% or higher, the course will not be in computations determining the
student’s grade point average or class rank. If a student fails the class, (below 60%), the F
grade will be calculated in the grade point average.

•

If a student receives a D- or higher, they receive credit for the course. The credit will count
toward meeting graduation requirements.

•

Attention student-athletes: NCAA assigns a 1.0 or the equivalent of a “D” for any course
taken under the Credit/No Credit (pass/fail) grading option.

Credits Obtained from Other Institutions

The district must be notified prior to the student taking any course in order for it to be
considered for future high school credit attainment. The course must be equivalent or beyond
Lakeville Area Public Schools course sequence. The course description and syllabus may be
requested for review. Students must meet with their Dean prior to registering for the course.

Credit Recovery

The Lakeville Pathways Academy program is designed for students that need to recover credits
in order to graduate. This allows students to maintain status and graduate with their class.
Courses are offered during the day and after regular school hours. Students must meet eligibility
criteria in order to enroll. Courses offered are English, social studies, science, math & some
elective areas.

Hybrid Courses
Hybrid courses include face-to-face instruction in the classroom part of the time and independent
online learning activities the remainder of the time. These courses meet the same Minnesota
State Standards and Lakeville Essential Learnings as traditional courses. Schoology is the
educational platform used to host the courses. Hybrid courses allow students to experience an
online course and develop digital learning skills. Courses that will be offered in the hybrid format
are designated throughout the Program of Studies and on the Course Selection Form. Students
taking hybrid courses are permitted to leave the building during their hybrid course on nonseminar days. Students staying in the building on a non-seminar day must remain in the assigned
hybrid area. Students who do not have access to technology at home will be provided access to
technology tools and be provided a time and space to complete work.

Independent Study

Independent Study refers to a course conducted with an instructor as a mentor, enabling the
student to explore a topic of interest. Independent Study provides students an opportunity to
expand their expertise in a particular area, explore a topic in detail, or develop advanced skills.
Independent Study is available to seniors to earn a semester credit in a course not offered by the
high school. An application is required. Upon successful completion of the Independent Study
course the student will be issued a “pass” for the semester credit.

Lakeville Online Academy

Lakeville Online Academy is a comprehensive, statewide online school through which students
can earn a Lakeville diploma. This academic option is for families and students looking for
anytime, anywhere learning that includes individualized instruction, flexibility in pace and
schedule, responsiveness to learning styles and self-selection of learning environment.
Students who benefit from this option should be self-directed, independent learners. Even
though students do their learning outside of a school building, they will receive a high-quality
educational experience that meets the state and local standards. A student enrolled in more than
50% of their courses through Lakeville Online Academy, becomes a Lakeville Online Academy
student, however, upon graduation will be issued a diploma from Lakeville North High School or
Lakeville South High School. Students must be residents and reside in the State of Minnesota to
attend Lakeville Online Academy.
23

Post-Secondary Enrollment Option (PSEO)

Postsecondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) is a program that allows 10th-, 11th- and 12th-grade
students to earn high school and college credit while still in high school, through enrollment in and
successful completion of college-level courses. PSEO courses are generally offered on the campus of
the postsecondary institution, however, some courses are offered online. Postsecondary institutions
are not allowed to charge PSEO students for tuition, textbooks or support services. Students may be
charged for equipment that becomes their property when the course or program is completed or for
textbooks that are not returned to the Postsecondary institution according to their policies.
Most PSEO courses are only open to high school students during their 11th- and 12th-grade year,
with each participating college and university setting their own requirements for enrollment into the
PSEO courses and programs. Additionally, there may be opportunities at industrialization centers
accredited by any accreditor recognized by the US Department of Education. Students may take
PSEO courses on a full- or part-time basis.
Many two- and four-year colleges and universities in Minnesota offer online courses and some of
them offer online degrees and certificates. Through the wide array of online courses offered in
Minnesota higher education, it is possible for PSEO students in our state to complete the Minnesota
Transfer Curriculum requirements and/or other courses that could result in an award in addition
to their high school diploma. School districts must allow a PSEO student reasonable access to the
high school building, computers and/or other technology resources during regular school hours to
participate in PSEO courses, whether on-line or on campus.
By March 1 of each year, a district must provide up-to-date information on the district’s website, and
in materials that are distributed to parents and students, about the program--including information
about enrollment requirements and the ability to earn postsecondary credit--to all pupils in grades 8,
9, 10, and 11.
Students must meet the PSEO eligibility requirements and abide by participation limits. However, if a
school district determines a pupil is not on track to graduate, she/he may still continue to participate
in PSEO.

How to Enroll in PSEO
Interested and eligible 11th- and 12th-grade students should contact the postsecondary institution
to find out their eligibility requirements, which courses are offered and what the application process
is at that institution. Access the list of Participating Postsecondary Institutions for a list of schools
and their contact information. Interested and eligible public 10th-grade students should contact the
postsecondary institution to find out which Career and Technical (CTE) courses are offered and what
the application process is at that institution.
To assist the district in planning, students are required to inform their district of their intent to enroll
in PSEO courses during the following school year by May 30. Students should meet with their
Dean to determine if PSEO is the right fit for them and their academic plan and to obtain more
information. Interested students must complete the Postsecondary Enrollment Options Program
Registration Form.

PSEO State-Approved Early/Middle College Programs
PSEO State- Approved Early/Middle College Programs allow eligible students to earn a high school
diploma while also earning postsecondary credits or conferring a degree or credential including a
24

certificate, diploma or an associate’s degree. Students are considered eligible if they are enrolled
in a core school day State-Approved Alternative Program (SAAP) under the graduation incentives
program as defined by MDE. Access a list of currently approved PSEO State-Approved Early/Middle
College Programs in Minnesota at the bottom of this page.

PSEO for 10th Graders to take Career and Technical Education (CTE) courses
Legislation allows eligible 10th grade students, including 10th grade nonpublic and home school
students, to enroll initially in one Career and Technical Education (CTE) course through PSEO. If
the student earns a “C” or higher grade in this first course, she/he is eligible to take additional
CTE courses while in 10th grade. In order to be eligible, a 10th grade student must have met the
proficiency level of “meets or exceeds” on the 8th grade MCA reading test. If the student did not
take the MCA, another reading assessment accepted by the enrolling postsecondary institution can
be substituted.
The Minnesota Department of Education has developed a new Policy entitled: Minnesota
Department of Education Alternative Eligibility Options Policy for 10th Grade Students with
a Disability who Wish to Participate in Career and Technical Education Classes through the
Postsecondary Enrollment Options Program. The policy and written procedures are effective
December 8, 2015. Access the policy, procedures and the Modifaction Request Form on the MN
Dept. of Education website.

Transportation Reimbursement for Qualified Students
Funds are available to help pay transportation expenses for PSEO students whose families are at or
below the poverty level, as determined by the federal government, to participate in PSEO courses
on college campuses. Access the Postsecondary Enrollment Options Mileage Reimbursement
Program Instructions.

Additional information to consider:
•

Students must meet the PSEO residency and eligibility requirements and abide by
participation limits specified in the Minnesota Statutes, section 124D.09.

•

PSEO credits will be awarded as 1/4 of the college credit amount (for example 4 college
credits = 2 high school semester credits or 1 full year)

•

Students may earn high school credits under PSEO and do not need to have completed all
high school requirements before participating in PSEO

•

PSEO grades are not weighted

For current information about the PSEO program, visit the Minnesota Department of Education’s
Postsecondary Enrollment Options (PSEO) webpage

Students will have the opportunity to take a Technical Skills Assessment (TSA) upon the completion
of some Career and Technical Education courses. Currently, upon completion of Foods 3, students
may take a ServSafe certification exam and upon completion of Building Construction/Applied
Architecture may take an OSHA 10 certification exam. If students earn a passing score on the
ServSafe exam, they will earn a food handler certificate from foodservice experts, the National
Restaurant Association. The OSHA 10 exam assesses an entry-level construction worker’s general
awareness on recognizing and preventing hazards on a construction site.

How to Figure GPA
1. Add point values for classes.

2. Divide by the number of classes marked
Class rank is determined by the numerical comparison of class members’ cumulative GPA’s. Class
rank and grade point average are calculated on the basis of credits earned. PSEO and University of
Minnesota Talented Youth Mathematics Program (UMTYMP) grades are reflected on the transcript.
PSEO, UMTYMP and concurrent credit grades are not weighted but are calculated into GPA and
class rank. Honors courses are not weighted. Only Advanced Placement courses are weighted.
Credits transferred (from another high school or any accredited institution) may be credited toward
state and district graduation requirements. Disclosure of students’ relevant high school academic
records, wherever their credits have been earned, will be provided by Lakeville High Schools to postsecondary institutions to the extent permitted by Minnesota law.
All transferred classes/credits entered on the student’s transcript will be counted in the cumulative
grade point average and class rank, unless recorded as a grade of “P” which has no effect on GPA.

Incomplete Grades

Students who, for acceptable reasons (e.g. illness, family emergency), receive an incomplete mark
(“I”) at the end of the quarter/semester will have two weeks to complete coursework and required
assessments. Incomplete grades posted on a transcript count as a zero toward cumulative GPA.
After the two-week period, the grade will be issued. Exceptions may be granted when special
circumstances exist.

Academic Lettering

Students must obtain a 3.7 or higher GPA during two consecutive semesters to be eligible for an
Academic Letter. Subsequent awards can be attained with two additional semesters of a 3.7 or
higher GPA.
Post-Secondary Planning Considerations
The best way to academically prepare for a four-year college or university is for students to challenge
themselves while in high school by taking rigorous courses in core subjects. Even if students have
completed the high school’s graduation requirements, it will increase chances for success in college
by taking more advanced mathematics, science, English and social studies courses.
Most four-year colleges and universities require the following, at a minimum, for admission:
•

Four years of English (including studies of writing and literature)

•

Three and one-half years of social studies (including one year each of U.S. history and geography)

•

Three years of mathematics (including two years of algebra and one year of geometry)
•

***Some colleges are now requiring four years of math

•

Three years of science (including one year each of a biological and physical science)

•

Two years of a single world language

•

One year of either world culture or fine arts
29

Public two-year colleges accept all high school graduates and GED holders. However, some
programs offered at these schools are more selective and have higher admissions standards and
waiting lists to get in. Some students find they must spend a semester or even two just getting ready
to enter a two-year career program by taking basic required courses they could have taken in high
school. That is why high school preparation is so important. Students who master core subjects while
in high school save money and time in college.
***Four years of math is required for admission to the University of Minnesota’s Twin Cities,
Duluth, Morris, and Rochester campuses.***

Associate Degrees
Associate degree programs require the equivalent of two years of full-time study. They are designed
to either prepare individuals for an occupation, or to provide a foundation for the completion of a
bachelor’s degree. Some general education courses are included in associate degree programs such
as English and mathematics.

Bachelor’s Degrees
All baccalaureate or bachelor’s degrees require the equivalent of at least four years of full-time study.
The degree includes both general courses and advanced course work in a defined area of study,
typically called a major. There are hundreds of programs of study that lead to a Bachelor of Arts
(B.A.), Bachelor of Science (B.S.), or discipline-specific bachelor’s degrees such as the Bachelor of
Music or the Bachelor of Fine Arts.

College Entrance Exams

Four-year colleges and universities in Minnesota require that students perform satisfactorily on an
entrance test such as the American College Test (ACT) or Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT). The ACT
tests four areas including English, math, science, and reading. There is also an optional 30-minute
writing test that students may request when registering for the ACT. It is not possible to register for
a separate ACT Writing Test; it must be taken in addition to and at the same time as four subject
area tests. More information about the ACT Assessment and the Writing Test is available at ACT.org.
Students should check if the writing portion is required for admission to their potential college. The
SAT contains three sections: critical reading, math, and writing. An optional essay section is based on
reading a passage, analyzing it and composing an essay in a 50-minute time period. Students should
check if the essay portion is required for admission to their potential college. More information
about the SAT is available at College Board.org.
Lakeville North High School’s testing code is 241-325
Lakeville South High School’s testing code is 241-326
Lakeville Online Academy’s testing code is 241-327

ART
Art is a subject that can be learned by all students. Students are exceptionally attuned to what
they see around them, and in art classes students will look for the meaning within images,
discuss ideas, discover artists, use their own experiences and develop an understanding of what
is happening within the student, the community, and the world as a source of content for their
artwork. Art foundations and skill development are strong components of the curriculum. It is
the philosophy of the art department to teach students to prepare work for display and provide
opportunities and encourage their best work.
Student Contributions: Art courses are hands-on, so attendance is crucial. Each student is
expected to spend at least two hours per week preparing for class. Projects will be assigned
with specific criteria and deadlines. Field trips will be offered to students during the semester
whenever appropriate exhibitions enhance the curriculum.
All art courses meet the requirements for the academic standards in the arts.

Minnesota Academic Standards in the Arts
Strand I: Artistic Foundations

Standard 1: Demonstrate knowledge of the foundations of the art area.
Standard 2: Demonstrate knowledge and use of the technical skills of the art form integrating
technology when applicable.
Standard 3: Demonstrate understanding of the personal, social, cultural, historical contexts
that influence the art areas.

Strand II: Artistic Process: Create/Make
Standard 1: Create/make in a variety of contexts in the art area using the artistic foundations.

Strand III: Artistic Process: Perform/Present
Standard 1: Perform/Present in a variety of contexts in the art area using the artistic

each individual’s lifestyle and personal goals. The following pages outline high school courses,
activities and opportunities related to six different career paths. This can be a resource for helping
determine which high school courses would be the most valuable to help students reach their future
goals.

Career Portfolio Requirements

The Minnesota Department of Education requires all school districts to participate in planning for
students’ successful transition to postsecondary education and employment. Legislation requires all
students, starting in grade nine to have a “plan” around several key elements: employability skills,
career development, mindsets and social awareness, and transitional knowledge.
The Lakeville Area Public Schools Career Portfolio requires each student to complete specific
career investigation activities in grades 9 – 12. The sequence of activities is intended to provide a
comprehensive experience in career exploration enabling students to pursue a lifelong career which
best matches their talents, abilities, and interests. Students create a portfolio on the Minnesota
Career Information System (MCIS), an Internet-based system, which combines a wealth of career,
education and labor market information into one comprehensive, easy-to-use exploration tool. This
occurs during one advisory period per month. During senior year, students are required to complete
a job shadow experience.

what they have learned in the previous three
courses to solve unique problems in science,
medicine, and healthcare using research and
design techniques on experiments and projects.
Students will work systematically through
required problems before completing optional
directed problems or independent work. Each
problem is staged as a mission – a unique set
of tasks the students must work through to
achieve their desired objective. Students are
presented with each problem in a Mission File
– a document that includes a case brief, a list of
completion tasks, links to available resources,
as well as a reflection section. Working through
the missions not only exposes students to
current issues in biomedical science, but it also
provides skills-based instruction in research
and experimentation – tools students will use
to design innovative solutions to real-world
problems. Students will use what they learn in
these missions as they develop and implement
their independent project at the end of the
year. A teacher may use additional resources
in the community – the guidance of other
teachers in the school, the advice of scientists
or biomedical professionals, or the knowledge
presented in scientific literature to help students
achieve each goal. Students practice problem

The study of world languages provides students with an opportunity to learn more about the
language, culture and traditions of other countries and builds essential skills for today’s global
society including: broadening your experiences, expanding your view of the world, contributing
to cultural awareness and literacy, building practical skills, improving the knowledge of your
own language through comparison and contrast with the world language, and expanding
opportunities for meaningful activities such as travel.
The fundamental objective of the World Languages Department is to encourage students to
become more aware of the world and its people through study of another language and culture.
Students will meet the following national standards of the American Council on the Teaching of
Foreign Languages (ACTFL):
• Communicate in languages other than English
• Gain knowledge and understanding of other cultures
• Connect with other disciplines and acquire related information
• Develop insight into the nature of language and culture
• Participate in multilingual communities at home and around the world (upper levels)
Studying World Languages is beneficial for students whether they decide to continue their
education, enter the workforce or travel. While the world language requirements for specific
colleges and universities vary, most require language study for degree-seeking students. The
world languages offered are American Sign Language, Spanish, and Honors Spanish.
