Course Description: 
 
This course is the study of a variety of medical 
interventions involved in the prevention, 
diagnosis, and treatment of disease as they 
follow the lives of a fictitious family. A “How-
To” manual for maintaining overall health 
and homeostasis in the body, the course will 
explore how to prevent and fight infection, 
how to screen and evaluate the code in our 
DNA, how to prevent, diagnose, and treat 
cancer, and how to prevail when the organs of 
the body begin to fail. Through these scenarios 
students will be exposed to the wide range of 
interventions related to immunology, surgery, 
genetics, pharmacology, medical devices, 
and diagnostics. Each family case scenario 
will introduce multiple types of interventions; 
reinforce concepts learned in the previous two 
Project Lead the Way courses, and present new 
content. Interventions may range from simple 
diagnostic tests to treatment of complex 
diseases and disorders. These interventions 
will be showcased across the generations of 
the family and will provide a look at the past, 
present, and future of biomedical science. 
Lifestyle choices and preventive measures are 
emphasized throughout the course as well as 
the important role that scientific thinking and 
engineering design play in the development of 
interventions of the future.
The primary units of study include: How to 
fight infection, how to screen what is in your 
genes, how to conquer cancer, and how to 
prevail when organs fail.
Students will demonstrate learning by 
completing activities, projects, and problems using a variety of assessment tools such as 
performance rubrics, reflective questioning 
and End-of-Course (EoC) assessments, 
to deepen and expand their knowledge. 
Students will practice problem solving with 
structured activities and progress to open-
ended projects and problems that require 
them to develop planning, documentation, 
communication, and other professional skills.


Course Recommendation:
 
This course is recommended for highly 
motivated, self-directed learners who have a 
strong interest in a medical profession.

medicine, physiology, biomedical engineering, 
and public health. They have the opportunity 
to work on an independent project and may 
work with a mentor or advisor from a university, 
hospital, physician’s office, or industry. 
Throughout the course, students are expected 
to present their work to an adult audience that 
may include representatives from the local 
business and healthcare community. 
The primary units of study include: Designing an 
effective Emergency Room, Exploring Human 
Physiology, Designing a Medical Innovation, 
Investigating Environmental Health, and 
Combating a Public Health Issue.
Students will demonstrate learning by applying 
what they have learned in the previous three 
courses to solve unique problems in science, 
medicine, and healthcare using research and 
design techniques on experiments and projects. 
Students will work systematically through 
required problems before completing optional 
directed problems or independent work. Each 
problem is staged as a mission – a unique set 
of tasks the students must work through to 
achieve their desired objective. Students are 
presented with each problem in a Mission File 
– a document that includes a case brief, a list of 
completion tasks, links to available resources, 
as well as a reflection section. Working through 
the missions not only exposes students to 
current issues in biomedical science, but it also 
provides skills-based instruction in research 
and experimentation – tools students will use 
to design innovative solutions to real-world 
problems. Students will use what they learn in 
these missions as they develop and implement 
their independent project at the end of the 
year. A teacher may use additional resources 
in the community – the guidance of other 
teachers in the school, the advice of scientists 
or biomedical professionals, or the knowledge 
presented in scientific literature to help students 
achieve each goal. Students practice problem 
solving with structured activities and progress to 
open-ended projects and problems that require 
them to develop planning, documentation, 
communication, and other professional skills.
